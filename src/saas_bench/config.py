# =============================================================================
# MARGIN DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
# Per-group profit margins emerge naturally from the interaction of three levers:
#   1. usage_demand (how many units/day a customer consumes)
#   2. c_max (maximum willingness to pay)
#   3. q_min/q_max → which model tier multiplier they need (higher tier = higher unit_cost)
#
# monthly_COGS_per_customer = usage_demand × 30 × MODEL_TIERS[tier].unit_cost
# gross_margin = (price - COGS) / price
#
# MARGIN SPECTRUM (realistic, matches real-world AI SaaS data):

# Channel targeting rationale:
# - S1 (price-sensitive): Social media viral discovery, referral program sharing
# - S2 (quality-focused): Search + content deep research, professional referrals
# - S3 (power users): Content + referral (tech communities), search for solutions
# - E1-E3 (enterprises): LinkedIn B2B targeting, content whitepapers; much lower volume.
#   Enterprise leads are ACCOUNT acquisitions (whole companies), not individual users.
#   Enterprise sales require procurement approval, security review, legal contracts —
#   making each lead much harder and more expensive to acquire than SMB.
#   Each account yields many seats (50-2000), but lead gen rate reflects per-account difficulty.

    # PMI is a leading indicator of B2B purchasing intent, published monthly by the

    # PMI > 50 = economic expansion (businesses buying more)
    # PMI < 50 = economic contraction (businesses cutting back)

    # to pay, and enterprise deal velocity.

    # PMI deviation from neutral (50) is scaled by group-specific beta coefficients.
    # Effect multiplier = 1.0 + macro_beta * (PMI - 50) / 50
    # At PMI=60 (strong expansion) with beta=0.3: multiplier = 1.0 + 0.3*(10/50) = 1.06 (+6%)
    # At PMI=40 (contraction) with beta=0.3: multiplier = 1.0 - 0.3*(10/50) = 0.94 (-6%)
    #
    # Effects applied to:
    #   1. Lead generation rate: more leads in expansion, fewer in contraction
    #   2. Willingness to pay (c_max): budgets expand/contract with economy
    #   3. Churn probability: inverse — higher churn in contraction
    #   4. Enterprise deal velocity: deals close faster in expansion

# MACROECONOMIC SENSITIVITY COEFFICIENTS (per customer group)
# =============================================================================
# Each group has a `macro_beta` dict specifying how sensitive it is to PMI changes.
# Beta values are calibrated from real-world cyclical sensitivity research.
#
# Three dimensions of macro sensitivity:
#   lead_generation: How much new customer acquisition changes with PMI
#   willingness_to_pay: How much budget/c_max shifts with PMI (also drives churn indirectly — lower c_max → plan downgrade/cancel)
#   deal_velocity: How much enterprise deal speed changes (enterprise only)
#
# INTERPRETATION:
#   beta = 0.0 → completely acyclical (no macro sensitivity)
#   beta = 0.3 → moderate sensitivity (±6% at PMI=40/60)
#   beta = 0.6 → high sensitivity (±12% at PMI=40/60)
#   beta = 1.0 → extreme sensitivity (±20% at PMI=40/60)
#

# R&D RESEARCH TIERS
# =============================================================================
# R&D tiers provide large, permanent quality boosts that are impractical to
# achieve via dev spending alone (dev spending saturates logarithmically).
# The agent MUST invest in R&D to keep pace with competitor events.
#
# 10 independent tiers — no dependencies. Any tier can be started at any time.
# Tiers are REPEATABLE — the same tier can be started multiple times.
# Cost grows linearly ($100K/tier); delay and quality boost grow non-linearly.
# HIGH VARIANCE: both duration and quality are sampled from Normal distributions
# with large standard deviations (~50% CV for quality, ~40-50% CV for delay).
#
# Economics (why R&D is necessary):
# - Dev spending at $1K/day = +0.25 quality/year ($365K). Logarithmic saturation.
# - Competitor pressure = ~+0.35 quality/year (events + drift).
# - Gap: ~+0.10/year that dev spending CANNOT close at any price.
# - Agent needs ~2-4 R&D invocations per year to stay competitive.

# =============================================================================
# Competitor-Event Reactivity (per-group q_bias shock coefficient)
# =============================================================================
# Each competitor event samples a `boost` magnitude (lognormal, scaled by
# late-game magnitude_scale). The simulator applies the raw boost to the
# GLOBAL q_bias accumulator (update_global_drift), then — for every group —
# adds `COMPETITOR_REACTIVITY_Q_BIAS[group_id] * boost` to that group's
# drift_q_bias_total accumulator. Coefficients are NOT centered at 1: they
# represent the additional reactivity ON TOP OF the global shift, so 0 means
# "no extra group-level reaction" and higher values mean the group is
# disproportionately sensitive to competitor moves.
#
# Design rationale (Attention × Switching axes):
# - High attention to AI-tool news + low switching cost → high coef
# - Low attention / compliance-bound / long procurement cycles → low coef
# - Values span 0.02 (sticky gov/bank, slow procurement) up to 0.35 (early-
#   adopter game-dev vertical that churns on every shiny launch).
#
# Applied to ALL 26 groups, including discoverable groups BEFORE discovery.
# The accumulator silently tracks shocks so that when a group is eventually
# discovered, sampled customers already reflect the full history of market
# disruption. q_bias shifts q_min AND q_max together (see _apply_drift_offsets).

# V2.2: Individual Subscriber Drift — Post-Subscription Behavioral Shifts
# =============================================================================
# Unlike GROUP_PREFERENCE_DRIFT (which shifts the group mean, affecting new customers too),
# individual drift applies ONLY to existing subscribers' personal parameters.
# New customers are unaffected — they sample from the original group distribution.
#
# This simulates real-world post-subscription behavioral changes:
# - Budget fatigue: subscribers scrutinize cost more over time (c_max shrinks)
# - Rising expectations: experienced users demand more quality (q_min/q_max rise)
# - Threshold sharpening: users develop stronger quality opinions (steepness_left rises)
# - Budget expansion: satisfied enterprise users expand spend (c_max grows)
# - Adaptation/loyalty: integrated users become more tolerant (steepness_left decreases)
#
# Rates are multiplicative: new = old × (1 + rate) per day
# Over 90 days: ±0.0005/day ≈ ±4.6%, ±0.001/day ≈ ±9.4%, ±0.002/day ≈ ±19.7%
