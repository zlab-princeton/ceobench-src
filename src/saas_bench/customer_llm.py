"""Customer LLM simulation for SaaS Bench.

This module generates:
1. Social media posts from customers (via Bedrock Haiku 4.5)
2. Enterprise negotiation responses (via Bedrock Sonnet 4.5)
3. VC negotiation responses (via same LLM as enterprise)

Social media uses Haiku 4.5 (fast/cheap for short creative posts).
Enterprise and VC negotiation use Sonnet 4.5 (smarter for complex negotiations).
Both default to AWS Bedrock, but can fall back to OpenAI if configured.

HOW TO RESPOND:
1. Read the agent's message carefully. What are they actually saying?
2. React naturally as a human would:
   - If their message is unclear or confusing → ask for clarification
   - If they're being pushy → push back or express hesitation
   - If they make a compelling point → acknowledge it
   - If they ask a question → answer it naturally
   - If they make an offer → evaluate it against your budget

3. Your current position on pricing: {decision.upper()}
   - ACCEPT: Their offer (${agent_offer.get('price_per_seat', 0) if agent_offer else 0:.2f}/seat) works for you
   - COUNTER: Propose ${final_offer_price:.2f}/seat/month
   - REJECT: Price is too high or deal doesn't work

4. Keep it natural:
   - Don't robotically state your decision
   - Respond to what they said, THEN weave in your position
   - Show appropriate emotion (enthusiasm, frustration, caution)
   - 2-4 sentences, like a real email/chat response
